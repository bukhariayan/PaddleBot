# PiHover
Pi hover is a innovative hovercraft project that will be capable of autonomous navigation using sensors such as IMUs, Time of Flight(ToF) sensors, and cameras. The goal of this projet is to fuse my love of embedded programming, electronic components, and physics to create a fun and educational engineering project.

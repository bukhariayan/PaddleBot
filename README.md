# PaddleBot
PaddleBot is a miniature robotic arm designed to be able to play ping pong. It will achieve this autonomously 
by emplying OpenCV, and open source computer vision library. By using inverse kinematics and simple physics equations, 
it can correctly predict the ball's location in order to send it back to the opponent. The goal for this project is to 
improve my skills in programming, hardware design, and physics.
